Exercises

A list of the exercises included in the repository, organized by chapter. Each exercise should include a brief description and a link to the source code.
Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

    Exercise 1-1: Run the "hello, world" program on your system.
    Exercise 1-2: Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above.
    Exercise 1-3: Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.
    ...

Chapter 2 - Types, Operators, and Expressions

    Exercise 2-1: Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long variables.
    Exercise 2-2: Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or ||.
    Exercise 2-3: Write a function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value.
    ...

Chapter 3 - Control Flow

    Exercise 3-1: Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.
    Exercise 3-2: Write a function escape(s, t) that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch.
    Exercise 3-3: Write a function expand(s1, s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.
